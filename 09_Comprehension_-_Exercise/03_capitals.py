"""
Using a dictionary comprehension, write a program that receives country names on the first line,
separated by comma and space ", ", and their corresponding capital cities on the second line
(again separated by comma and space ", ") and prints each country, with their capital,
on a separate line in the following format:
"{country} -> {capital}"
Hints
Â· You can use the zip() method to zip the two lists into tuple pairs.
