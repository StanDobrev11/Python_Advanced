"""
On the first line, you will be given an integer N, which represents the size of a square matrix. On the second line you
will receive the racing number of the tracked race car.
On the next N lines you will be given the rows of the matrix (string sequences, separated by whitespace), which will
be representing the race route. The tracked race car always starts with coordinates [0, 0]. Thеre will be a tunnel
somewhere across the race route. If the race car runs into the tunnel , the car goes through it and exits at the other
end. There will be always two positions marked with "T"(tunnel). The finish line will be marked with "F". All
other positions will be marked with ".".
Keep track of the kilometers passed. Every time the race car receives a direction and moves to the next position of
the race route, it covers 10 kilometers. If the car goes through the tunnel, it covers NOT 10, but 30 kilometers.
On each line, after the matrix is given, you will be receiving the directions for the race car.
 left
 right
 up
 down
The race car starts moving across the race route:
 If you receive "End" command, before the race car manages to reach the finish line, the car is disqualified
and the following output should be printed on the Console: "Racing car {racing number} DNF."
 If the race car comes across a position marked with ".". The car passes 10 kilometers for the current move
and waits for the next direction.
 If the race car comes across a position marked with "T" this is the tunnel. The race car goes through it and
moves to the other position marked with "T" (the other end of the tunnel). The car passes 30 kilometers
for the current move. The tunnel stays behind the car, so the race route is clear, and both the positions
marked with "T", should be marked with ".".
 If the car reaches the finish line ‐ "F" position, the race is over. The tracked race car manages to finish the
stage and the following output should be printed on the Console: "Racing car {racing number}
finished the stage!". Don’t forget that the car has covered another 10 km with the last move.
Input
 On the first line you will receive N ‐ the size of the square matrix (race route)
 On the second line you will receive the racing number of the tracked car
 On the next N lines, you will receive the race route (elements will be separated by a space).
 On the following lines, you will receive directions (left, right, up, down).
 On the last line, you will receive the command "End".
Output
 If the racing car has reached the finish line before the "End" command is given, print on the Console:
"Racing car {racing number} finished the stage!"
 If the "End" command is given and the racing car has not reached the finish line yet, the race ends and the
following message is printed on the Console: "Racing car {racing number} DNF."
 On the second line, print the distance that the tracked race car has covered: "Distance covered
{kilometers passed} km."
 At the end, mark the last known position of the race car with "C" and print the final state of the matrix
(race route). The row elements in the output matrix should NOT be separated by a whitespace.
Constraints
 The directions will always lead to coordinates in the matrix.
 There will always be two positions marked with "T" , representing the tunnel in the race route.
 The size of the square matrix (race route) will be between [4…10].

                Racing car 01 finished the
                stage!
                Distance covered 80 km.
                .....
                .....
                .....

                ..C..
                                The race car starts moving from
                                position[0,0].
                                The first command is down, so the
                                moving direction is down. The race
                                car is in position[1,0].
                                Next three commands are right, so
                                the race car comes across the tunnel
                                – "T". The current car position is [1,3].
                                Swap the "T" with "." The race car
                                goes through the tunnel, so its next
                                position is [3,1]. Swap the "T" with "."
                                Next direction is down, so the race
                                car position is [4,1].
                                Next direction is right, so the race car
                                position is [4,2].
                                The race car reaches the finish line
                                before the "End" command. So it
                                manages to finish the stage. The
                                remaining directions will be ignored
                                and no more moves are going to be
                                executed.
